## ⚡ Features

Blessed by the ancient ones with:

- **Optimized Performance** - Swifter than Horus in flight

  - Linux (as powerful as Sekhmet)
- **Divine Navigation** - Refresh and home buttons blessed by Thoth himself

## 🏃‍♂️ Development Setup

To summon this project locally (as approved by the gods):

# Install dependencies (like gathering resources for a pyramid)
pnpm install

# Summon the development instance
pnpm dev
```

## 🏗️ Building for Production

```

This will create sacred scrolls for Windows (.exe), macOS (.dmg), and Linux (.AppImage) in the `build` directory.
